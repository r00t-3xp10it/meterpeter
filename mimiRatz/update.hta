Release Date: 02/01/2024
Version: OS Builds 19041.1161, 19042.1161 and 19043.1161

This update makes quality improvements to the servicing stack, which is the component that installs Windows updates.
Servicing stack updates (SSU) ensure that you have a robust and reliable servicing stack so that your devices can
receive and install Microsoft updates. IMPORTANT This release includes the Flash Removal Package. Taking this update
will remove Adobe Flash from the machine. For more information, see the Update on Adobe Flash Player End of Support.

Devices with Windows installations created from custom offline media or custom ISO image might have Microsoft Edge
Legacy removed by this update, but not automatically replaced by the new Microsoft Edge. This issue is only encountered
when custom offline media or ISO images are created by slipstreaming this update into the image without having first
installed the standalone servicing stack update (SSU) released March 29, 2023 or later.
